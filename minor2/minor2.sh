# SCRIPT DESCRIPTION:
# Write a complete bash script that monitors who logs in and logs out of the current CSE
# Linux machine (e.g., cell01, cell02, etc.) where the script is running.
#   - You will check the status of who is logged in every 10 seconds and report each
#   user ID that logs in or logs out during that time frame. Note that there may be
#   more than one user that logs in or out during this interval.
#   - You must include the host name when reporting the user ID information.
#   - In addition, you will install a custom signal handler to trap the SIGINT (i.e., ^C)
#   one time before you are able to terminate the script with the SIGINT.
#   - You will also print out the current date and time and report the number of users
#   logged in, even if there are no changes (i.e., no one logged in or out during the
#   interval).
# Please see the SAMPLE OUTPUT for several examples, including the different
# scenarios that might occur.

# REQUIREMENTS:
# • Your script should be well documented in terms of comments. For example, good
# comments in general consist of a header (with your name, course section, date,
# and brief description), comments for each variable, and commented blocks of
# code. • Your bash script should be named “minor2.sh”, without the quotes.
# Note that this must be done as a bash script, not a C program.
# • Your script will be graded based largely on whether it works correctly on the
# CELL machines (e.g., cell01, cell02, ..., cell06), so you should make sure
# that your script runs on a CELL machine.
# • Please pay attention to the SAMPLE OUTPUT for how this script is expected to
# work. If you have any questions about this, please contact your instructor or TAs
# assigned to this course to ensure you understand these directions.
# • This is an individual programming assignment that must be the sole work of the
# individual student. Any instance of academic dishonesty will result in a grade of
# “F” for the course, along with a report filed into the Academic Integrity Database.
