# Write a bash script that (1) prompts the user to enter a Linux command and reads in
# the user’s input, (2) prints out a meaningful message with the user’s entered
# command to be executed, and finally (3) executes the user’s entered command. The
# Linux command is to be read in, not passed as a command-line argument. This bash
# script should be called rec04B.sh.
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT (input in asterisks):
# $ ./rec04B.sh
# Enter Linux command to perform: **ls**
# Command to be executed: ls
# a.out Lab01A.c Lab02B.sh minor1.c minor2.c
# $ ./rec04B.sh
# Enter Linux command to perform: **ls -l**
# Command to be executed: ls -l
